## Project Overview

This project is a web-based version of the classic dice game **Farkle**. Our goal is to deliver a fun, polished, and highly customizable Farkle experience in the browser. The game features interactive dice, robust score banking, run/turn management, and dynamic scoring rules. The main distinguishing feature is the planned addition of **Chaos Modifiers** that radically change the gameplay.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Dice Rolling:** Six dice rolled with secure, pseudo-randomness.
- **Dice Selection:** Select dice showing 1, 5, or valid sets for scoring (e.g., three-of-a-kind).
- **Score Banking:** Bank points from selected dice to your current run score.
- **Run and Turn Management:** Core game logic for banking scores, ending turns, and losing a run (Farkle!).
- **Standard Scoring Rules:** Support for three-of-a-kind, single 1s and 5s, and more.
- **Dynamic UI:** Responsive buttons and score displays to guide the player.
- **Planned Polish:** Improved CSS styling, layout, and a tutorial overlay.

## ü§Ø Chaos Modifiers (Planned)

The Chaos Modifiers are game-altering rules designed to shake up the standard Farkle experience and increase replayability. These features are prioritized as they represent the project's unique value proposition.


- **Variable Dice Pool** On roll, the number of dice available is randomly set between 4 and 8 (instead of the standard 6).
- **Double Points** A randomly selected die (or a specific die value) has its score value doubled *if* it is successfully banked.
- **Forced Bank** At the beginning of the turn, the player is forced to select and bank a single '1' or '5' *if available*, disrupting plans for larger sets.
- **Mirror Image** When a player banks a set of three dice, the next die rolled will automatically show the same value as the **lowest** banked die in that set (for the first roll only).
- **Custom Scoring** Planned option to allow players to change the point requirements or values of 1s, 5s, and sets before the game starts.

## How to Play

1.  **Roll Dice:** Click **"Roll All Dice"** to roll the available dice.
2.  **Select Dice:** Click dice showing 1, 5, or valid sets (like three-of-a-kind) to move them to the banked area and add their value to your score.
3.  **Bank Score:** Click **"Bank Score"** to add your current banked points to your run score and remove those dice from play.
4.  **Continue Rolling:** Keep rolling and banking until you lose your run or choose to end your turn.
5.  **End Turn:** Click **"End Turn"** to add your total run score to your overall score and start a new run with all six dice.
6.  **Lose Run (Farkle):** If you roll and **no** dice can be selected, your entire run score resets to zero, and your turn ends.
